\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{W}{earable} medical devices (WMDs) have emerged as transformative tools in healthcare, providing continuous monitoring of physiological parameters and enabling personalized health management. These devices are designed to be worn on the body or integrated into clothing, allowing users to track vital signs and health metrics during daily activities or in clinical settings without significant discomfort. Rapid advances in biomedical technologies, microelectronics, material science, and data analytics have paved the way for the widespread adoption of WMDs, revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered.

The significance of WMDs lies in their potential to improve health outcomes by offering real-time monitoring, early detection of health anomalies, and seamless communication with healthcare providers. They empower patients to take a proactive role in their health, while healthcare professionals can use the collected data to provide more informed and timely interventions. In addition, the growing popularity of wearable health technologies has sparked considerable interest in both consumer markets and clinical applications, with more than a billion devices estimated to be in use globally by 2022.

Despite their growing popularity, wearable medical devices come with their own set of challenges, including data privacy concerns, regulatory hurdles, and limitations in sensor accuracy and power management. Addressing these challenges is crucial for maximizing the potential of WMDs and integrating them into mainstream healthcare effectively. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of wearable medical devices, covering their historical evolution, architecture, applications, materials, regulatory requirements, advantages and disadvantages, and the challenges and future directions facing the industry.

The review is structured as follows: Section \ref{2.What_are} provides an overview of wearable medical devices, defining their purpose and categorizing different types. Section \ref{3.Historical} trace the historical evolution of WMDs, from early monitoring devices to modern sophisticated technologies. Section \ref{4.Architecture} explores the architecture of wearable devices, including their core components and data flow mechanisms. Section \ref{5.Applications} examines the various applications of WMD, from health monitoring to rehabilitation. Section \ref{6.Materials} discusses the materials used in wearable devices, focusing on advances in material science that have improved the functionality of the device. Section \ref{7.Advantages} outlines the advantages and disadvantages of WMDs, while Section \ref{8.Regulatory} details the regulatory standards and requirements that ensure their safety and efficacy. Finally, Section \ref{9.Challenges} delves into the challenges that must be overcome and the future directions of wearable medical devices.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your

\section{What are Wearable Medical Devices?}
\label{2.What_are}
    \subsection{Definition and Purpose}

    Wearable Medical Devices (WMDs) are advanced tools designed to provide continuous monitoring of various physiological parameters without disrupting users' daily routines. These devices integrate seamlessly into daily life, allowing monitoring of vital signs during activities such as work or exercise, and are also applicable in clinical settings~\cite{Fotiadis2006}. The development of WMDs has been driven by rapid advances in biomedical technologies, micro and nanotechnologies, materials engineering, electronic systems, and information technology, resulting in increased comfort, precision, and widespread adoption of these devices~\cite{Degerli2020, Fotiadis2006}. In 2022, more than a billion wearable medical devices were in use worldwide.

    The term "wearable" encompasses devices that are worn directly on the body or integrated into clothing, while "medical device" refers to the tools used for medical functions such as monitoring, aiding recovery, or supporting long-term care. WMDs are designed to be autonomous, non-invasive and tailored to support these medical functions, ultimately aiming to improve patient health~\cite{Degerli2020}. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a medical device must perform its intended function without relying on drugs or other biological substances, positioning WMDs as highly diverse - from simple wearable sensors to sophisticated electrodes for cardiac monitoring~\cite{Khan2016, Ates2022}.

    \subsection{Categories of Wearable Devices}
    
    Wearable medical devices can be classified into three main categories according to their primary purpose: monitoring devices, medical aids, and rehabilitation devices~\cite{Fotiadis2006}.
    
        \subsubsection{Wearable Monitoring Devices}
        These devices are used to monitor and manage chronic diseases and measure vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, and body fat. They provide critical data that help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about patient care. Examples include smart watches with health tracking capabilities and portable ECG monitors.

        \subsubsection{Wearable Medical Aids}
        Designed for patients with disabilities, these devices provide ongoing support to people with temporary or permanent physical limitations. Examples include hearing aids and contact lenses, which help improve daily functioning and improve patient quality of life.

        \subsubsection{Wearable Rehabilitation Devices}
        These devices are often used in patients recovering after surgery or other high-risk situations. Rehabilitation wearables combine monitoring features with assistive functions to support the patient during recovery. Examples include exoskeletons and other devices that help regain mobility and strengthen muscles~\cite{Hemapriya2017}.

    \subsection{Key Features and Requirements}
    Wearable medical devices must meet several essential requirements to distinguish themselves from traditional medical equipment. They must be portable, compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient, enabling prolonged use without frequent recharging. The devices should also be durable, reliable, and biocompatible to withstand the conditions of everyday use. Given the constant interaction between the device and the user, a simple and intuitive user interface is vital~\cite{Lu2020}.

    In general, WMDs share five core characteristics: (1) wireless connectivity for easy data transfer, (2) interactive capabilities that promote intelligent responses to health data, (3) sustainability and robustness under normal wear and tear, (4) simplicity in operation and design for user convenience, and (5) wearability, meaning they should be comfortable to wear for extended periods~\cite{Lu2020}.

\section{Historical Evolution of Wearable Medical Devices}
